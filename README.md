# MachineLearning
Exploring machine learning topics in Python. 

<h2>Inspiration:</h2> 

The idea of a program being able to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicetely programmed, is something that I find truly fascinating. 

I have built two projects, LawyerUp and MyChauffeur, that train models but leverage external modules and algorithms. I wanted to understand more about these algorithms and so I decided to follow machine learning tutorials and online lectures on YouTube. 

So far I have built a support vector machine algorithm, a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm, a linear regression algorithm, and a KMeans algorithm. I had a great time building these algorithms because I was able to familiarize myself with popular python modules like scikit-learn, pandas, mathplotlib, scipy, sklearn, and numpy. 

I plan to continue learning and I hope that I can soon build a neural network completely from scratch.
